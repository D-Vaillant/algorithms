## Sorting Algorithms
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>__Name__</td>
        <td>__Python__</td>
        <td>__C__</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Insertion</td>
        <td>&#x2713;</td>
        <td>&#x2713;</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Searching Algorithms
I'll do this later.

## Data Structures
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>__Name__</td>
        <td>__Python__</td>
        <td>__C__</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Linked List</td>
        <td>&#x2717;</td>
        <td>&#x2713;</td>
    </tr>
